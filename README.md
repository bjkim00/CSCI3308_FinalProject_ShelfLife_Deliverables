ShelfLife is a website designed for a restraurant to track all its data in one place. Our website has five main features. Our inventory feature allows the user to view their stocked and low inventory items. This page displays the each ingredient's name, the unit it is measured in, and the amount in stock. The order forms feature allows the user to reorder inventory. This page displays current inventory and give the user an option to reorder specific ingredints. The sales feature allows the user to view the restraunt's past sales. The user can view the sales for the current day, week, month or year. The send order feature allows the user to ring in a guests food order. When a dish is ordered, the inventory and sales information are updated. Lastly, the account feature allows the user to change their password or add a menu item. If a new ingredient is needed for an added menu item, it is added to the inventory page with a quantity of 0. The menu item is added to the send order page. ShelfLife allows for easy management and analysis of a restraunt's data all in one place.
